Scibash is a simple UNIX command interpreter that is part of the low-level programming module at ALX School. It is
intended to emulate the basics of the sh shell. Scibash can be invoked interactively and non-interactively. To start,
compile all .c files in the repository using the command: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o scibash. Scibash was
created by Uchechukwu Emmanuel and Chikamnele Fortune. For more information, consult the scibash and bash man pages.
